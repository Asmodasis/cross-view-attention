# cross-view-attention
A typical mammogram examination is done using a machine that generates four images, these four images will be represented of each breast (two) and each view of each breast (two). The views are labeled as craniocaudal and mediolateral oblique and two views have both a left and right image taken of them. A radiologist will view each of these four images to find suspected lesions. When a lesion is located, the radiologist will examine the other views.

If the lesion is contained in the same breast but of a different view then this increases the chance of the lesion diagnosis being accurate. Since lesions do not often occur symmetrically, the radiologist will examine the same view of the other breast to confirm that the other breast does not contain the suspected lesion. This is referred to as cross-view attention. 


The purpose of this project is to mimic the attention method as employed by radiologists using deep neural networks.
